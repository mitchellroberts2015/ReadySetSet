# ReadySetSet

_"SET, the family game of visual perception"_ is a game that rewards quick pattern matching and methodical analysis. The rules of the game are simple to understand, but hard to master: your job is to find sets of 3 cards that for which each of the 4 features that describe each card are either all the same or different. We decided that by applying AR, we could quickly teach new players the rules of the game and help them play competitively against their more experienced friends.
